Super simple, super fast, Uses youtube-dl's python library. Just open, select if you want video or just audio, and paste the url.

To install:
----
1. download this repo as a zip or using Git.
2. There is no step two. you have been fooled. maybe extract the zip i guess.

how to use:
----
1.	run the batch file
2.	type 1 for video or 2 for audio in the console
3.  paste a youtube link into the console
- the output will appear in the same directory as the batch file.

Notes:
----
- It checks if you have ffmpeg in your PATH. If not then it downloads it to a folder named ffmpeg in the batch directory

Todo:
----
- [ ] add pass-through flags if using secondary batch file with the current values as default.
- [ ] add more flags to be added if wanted through the console interface
